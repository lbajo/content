title: 'ROS2 System Checks'

description: |-
    When you try to use ROS2 technology, you can also add the 
    SROS2 security package to the installation.
    The SROS2 package provides security to the ROS2 node system, 
    adding authentication, encryption and access control.
    With these rules, the check will be carried out that the configuration 
    of this package has been carried out correctly.
